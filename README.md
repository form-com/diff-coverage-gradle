`Diff coverage` is JaCoCo extension that computes code coverage of new/modified code based on a provided [diff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format). 
The diff content can be provided via path to patch file, URL or using embedded git(see [parameters description](#Parameters-description)).   

Why should I use it?
* forces each developer to be responsible for its own code quality(see [diffCoverage task](#gradle-task-description))
* helps to increase total code coverage(especially useful for old legacy projects)
* reduces time of code review(you don't need to waste your time to track what code is covered)

## Installation
Add plugin dependency  
```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.github.form-com.diff-coverage-gradle:diff-coverage:0.7.0'
    }
}
```
Apply `JaCoCo`(for coverage data generation) and `Diff Coverage`(for diff report generation) plugins  
```
apply plugin: 'jacoco'
apply plugin: 'com.form.diff-coverage'
```
## Configuration
```
diffCoverageReport {
    diffSource.file = ${PATH_TO_DIFF_FILE} 
    
    jacocoExecFiles = files(jacocoTestReport.executionData)
    classesDirs = files(jacocoTestReport.classDirectories)
    srcDirs = files(jacocoTestReport.sourceDirectories)

    reports {
        html = true
    }
}
```

        srcDirs = files(jacocoTestReport.sourceDirectories)
    
        reports {
            html = true
        }
    }
    diffCoverage.dependsOn += check
  ```

## Execute

```
./gradlew check diffCoverage
```

## Parameters description
```
diffCoverageReport {
    diffSource { // Required. Only one of `file`, `url` or git must be spesified
        file = 'path/to/file.diff' //  Path to diff file 
        url = 'http://domain.com/file.diff' // URL to retrieve diff by
        git.compareWith 'develop' // Compares current HEAD and all uncommited with provided branch, revision or tag 
    }
    jacocoExecFiles = files('/path/to/jacoco/exec/file.exec') // Required
    srcDirs = files('/path/to/sources')  // Required
    classesDirs = files('/path/to/compiled/classes') // Required

    reports {
        html = true // Optional. default `false`
        reportDir = 'dir/to/store/reports' // Optional. Default 'build/reports/jacoco/diffCoverage'
    }

    violationRules {
        minBranches = 0.9 // Optional. Default `0.0`
        minLines = 0.9 // Optional. Default `0.0`
        minInstructions = 0.9 // Optional. Default `0.0`
        failOnViolation = true // Optional. Default `false`
    }
}
```

## Gradle task description
The plugin adds a task `diffCoverage` that has no dependencies
  * loads code coverage data specified by `diffCoverageReport.jacocoExecFiles`
  * analyzes the coverage data and filters according to `diffSource.url`/`diffSource.file`
  * generates html report(if enabled: `reports.html = true`) to directory `reports.baseReportsDir`
  * checks coverage ratio if `violationRules` is specified. 
    
    Violations check is enabled if any of `minBranches`, `minLines`, `minInstructions` is greater than `0.0`.
    
    Fails the execution if the violation check is enabled and `violationRules.failOnViolation = true`

## Violations check output example

Passed:
> \>Task :diffCoverage
>
> Fail on violations: true. Found violations: 0.

Failed:
>\> Task :diffCoverage FAILED
>
>Fail on violations: true. Found violations: 2.
>
>FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
>
>...
>
>\> java.lang.Exception: Rule violated for bundle diff-coverage-gradle: instructions covered ratio is 0.5, but expected minimum is 0.9
> 
> Rule violated for bundle diff-coverage-gradle: lines covered ratio is 0.0, but expected minimum is 0.9



## HTML report example

`Diff Coverage` plugin generates standard JaCoCo HTML report, but highlights only modified code
